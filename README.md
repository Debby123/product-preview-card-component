## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to style and center images. I also made use of the position css property as well as flex.

### Continued development

This isn't perfect at all as i just started taking web development serious. This is one of my first projects. 
i'll have to study   and practice more on **CSS** properties. It's quite obvious, i had a lot of tough time styling this project. Your reviews are highly appreciated. Would help me do better as a self-taught and currently learning web developer.
